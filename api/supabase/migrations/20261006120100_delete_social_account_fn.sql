--
-- Delete a social account and reconcile scheduled/draft posts that reference it.
--
-- - Scheduled/draft posts whose ONLY account is this connection are deleted
--   outright (their child rows cascade via existing FKs), rather than being
--   left referencing zero accounts.
-- - Media/configuration rows scoped to this connection on *scheduled/draft*
--   posts that still have other accounts are explicitly removed, rather than
--   relying on ON DELETE SET NULL, which would otherwise silently reclassify
--   them as applying to the whole post.
-- - Media/configuration rows on posts in any other status (e.g. already
--   published) are left alone so the existing ON DELETE SET NULL FK
--   preserves them as historical record, instead of deleting the row.
